This project creates a user-friendly AR application that empowers India’s artisans by showcasing their handicrafts in realistic 3D right where the user is. Users scan a surface (wall, floor, table) and the app suggests items that match the room’s style and the user’s preferences. Each item is accompanied by the artisan’s profile, making-of videos, price and direct contact or UPI payment options. The app includes features to onboard artisans, run virtual craft-fairs, host AR-guided micro-workshops, and track economic impact — making culture discovery interactive, educative and economically empowering.
